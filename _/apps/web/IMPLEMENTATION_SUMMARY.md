## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Architecture
- **Supabase PostgreSQL**: Production-ready database with automatic backups
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Comprehensive security policies for all tables
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic profile creation, rating calculations, conversation updates
- **Indexes**: Optimized for performance on frequently queried columns

### API Architecture
- **Supabase Integration**: All endpoints use Supabase client with proper error handling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with proper user validation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with business logic validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with meaningful messages

### Security Features
- **RLS Policies**: Data access restricted by user relationships
- **Input Validation**: All endpoints validate required fields and data types
- **Business Logic**: Prevents invalid operations (e.g., self-applications, duplicate reviews)
- **Authentication Guards**: All protected endpoints require valid user sessions
